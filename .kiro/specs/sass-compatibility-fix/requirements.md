# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to fix the Sass compatibility issue in the Taro mini-program project. Currently, the build process fails with an error related to Sass compilation, specifically with a TypeError indicating that a JSArray is not a subtype of JSImporter. This issue prevents successful builds and needs to be resolved to enable proper development and deployment of the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the Sass compilation error in the build process, so that I can successfully build and deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL compile Sass files without errors
2. WHEN using Sass imports in the project THEN the system SHALL correctly process these imports
3. WHEN the build process completes THEN the system SHALL generate the expected CSS output
4. IF there are compatibility issues between Sass and the build tools THEN the system SHALL use appropriate configuration or workarounds to resolve them

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the Sass configuration is compatible with the latest versions of the build tools, so that future updates don't break the build process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the current version of Sass (1.89.2) THEN the system SHALL work correctly with the project's build configuration
2. IF the Sass configuration needs to be updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing styles
3. WHEN the project is built with different environments (development, production) THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent Sass compilation behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation on the Sass configuration and any workarounds applied, so that I can maintain the project effectively in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fix is implemented THEN the system SHALL include comments explaining the changes made
2. IF specific workarounds are applied THEN the system SHALL document why they were necessary
3. WHEN future developers work on the project THEN the system SHALL provide them with sufficient information to understand the Sass configuration
